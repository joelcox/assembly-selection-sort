Selection sort in x86 assembly
==============================

This repository implements a slightly modified selection sort algorithm in x86 assembly. The modification is in the returned value which is the sum of all `min_i` values.

All code--except for the code in `my_selection_sort.s`--was written by [David N. Jansen](http://www.cs.ru.nl/D.Jansen/) for [IBK003](http://www.studiegids.science.ru.nl/2012/science/course/28162/).
